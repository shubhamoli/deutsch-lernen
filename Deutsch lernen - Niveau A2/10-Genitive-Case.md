# Genitive Case

ðŸ’¡ Donâ€™t ignore this emoji, It means there is some very useful tip for you.

---

German language has four cases. We already know three of them: _nominative, accusative_ and _dative_. The fourth one is called _genitive_ (genitiv). 

The genitive is used to express possession or belonging. **A noun is described more precisely by another noun in the genitive.** 

A noun can be complemented by another noun in the genitive, called "*das Genitivattribut*", which tells us who somethingÂ belongs to. 

If the "*Genitivattribut*" is a name, it generally comes before the other noun and gets the ending _-s_.

zum Beispiele:
- Das ist Selma**s** Handy.
- Das ist Sebastian**s** Gitarre

An apostrophe is used instead of the ending -s if the name or proper noun already ends in an s-sound (_-s_, _-ÃŸ_, _-z_ or _-x_):
	- Das ist Thomasâ€™Â Auto.
	- Das is Max' Fahrrad.

ðŸ’¡We mostly use the genitive in written language. In spoken language we often use "von" + dative.
z. B. - 
- Das ist die DVD des Lehrers.
- Das ist die DVD von dem Lehrer.

### ðŸ’¡Tips
- The ending _-s_ is added to most masculine and neuterÂ nouns. Feminine and plural nouns do not take an ending.
- Nouns that end with an s- or a z-sound ("_-s_", "_-ÃŸ_", "_-z_" or "_-x_") always form the genitive with the ending "_-es_".  
- With single-syllable nouns in the genitive masculine and neuter we usually use "-es".  
- In some cases both "-s" and "-es" are correct. For example: "des Films" / "des Filmes".
- If the genitive attributeÂ is not a proper name, it generally comes after the noun that it is modifying.

# Genitive Case

ðŸ’¡ Donâ€™t ignore this emoji, It means there is some very useful tip for you.

German has four cases. We already know three of them: _nominative, accusative_ and _dative_. The fourth is called _genitive_. The genitive is used to express possession or belonging.

A noun can be complemented by another noun in the genitive, called "*das Genitivattribut*", which tells us who somethingÂ belongs to. 
If the "*Genitivattribut*" is a name, it generally comes before the other noun and gets the ending _-s_.

Biespiele:
- Das ist Selma**s** Handy.
- Das ist Sebastian**s** Gitarre

An apostrophe is used instead of the ending -s if the name or proper noun already ends in an s-sound (_-s_, _-ÃŸ_, _-z_ or _-x_):
	- Das ist Thomasâ€™Â Auto.
	- Das is Max' Fahrrad.

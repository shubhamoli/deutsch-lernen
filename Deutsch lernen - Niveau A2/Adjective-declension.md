# Adjective declension

ðŸ’¡ Donâ€™t ignore this emoji, It means there is some very useful tip for you.

## Revision
If an adjective directly precedes the noun that it describes, the ending of the adjective changes according to the noun. This change to the adjective is called adjective declension. 
There are three different declensions. What declension to use depends on the article before the noun: indefinite article, definite article or no article.

**Declining adjectives when there is no article**
If a noun has no article, the adjective takes the ending of a definite article.

Biespiele:
- Das Essen ist lecker - Leckers Esses
- Der Tee ist heiÃŸ - HeiÃŸer Tee
- Die Musik ist schÃ¶n - SchÃ¶ne Musik

**Adjective declension after the definite article**
If the noun comes afterÂ a **definite** article, the adjective has the ending _-e_ or _-en_.

We already know the endings of the adjectives in the nominative and the accusative:
- Adjectives before nouns in the plural (nominative, accusative) have the ending _-en_.
- In the accusative, adjectives before masculine nouns also have the ending _-en_.
- Other adjectives have the ending _-e_.

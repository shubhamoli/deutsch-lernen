## Transition from A1 to A2 

At A1 level we learnt about fundamental concepts of German grammar like *Nouns*, *Pronouns*, *Cases*, *Articles*, etc to form basic sentences, but in here in A2 the primary focus is on building a bit more complex sentences.

In A2 we will learn more about Subordinate clauses, indirect questions, reflexive verbs and pronouns, Adverbs, using simple past tense and many more such concepts along with a new Case known as *Genitiv*.

## One important Tip

Apart from our usual Nico's Weg, I would recommend watching small storylines in Youtube and see how much of it makes sense to you. Listening to the native speakers speaking at their own pace is a very important exercise for your comprehension abilities and make sense of the conversation and even hold the conversation with them. Apart from that, listening to native speakers also helps you learn colloquial forms of certain phrases instead of the constructed ones.

Following are the my recommendations to watch. You can turn on the subtitles (in German) to understand the words (which you didn't catch initially).
- [Mein Weg nach Deutschland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMj9kUPrnBk)
- [Pluspunkt Deutsch A 1 Ganzer Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9-LI-FD6dQ)

I'm pretty sure you'll be able to understand >60% of it.

## Some More Tips
- Usually the dative part comes before the accusative part in a sentence containing both
	- z. B - Nina schenkt *ihr* einen *Besen*.
	- z. B. - _Lisa **hat** **mit** Max und Tarek **über** das nächste Konzert **gesprochen
- But, if the accusative object is a pronoun, the word order changes. Then the pronoun comes before the dative object. It doesn't matter whether the dative object is a noun or a pronoun.
	- z. B. - Das ist ein Massage-Gutschein. Lisa hat *ihn* ihrem Freund Nico geschenkt.

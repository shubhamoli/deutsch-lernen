# Subordinate Clauses

ðŸ’¡ Donâ€™t ignore this emoji, It means there is some very useful tip for you.

**der Hauptsatz:** In general, a main clause consists of at least a subject and a conjugated verb. It is a self-contained clause which may stand alone. In simple declarative sentences, the verb is the second idea.

**der Nebensatz:** A subordinate clause cannot normally stand alone. It is dependent on a superordinate main clause or another subordinate clause. The conjugated verb is normally right at the end of a subordinate clause. Many subordinate clauses are linked to the superordinate clause by certain introductory words.

## **Subordinated clauseÂ before the main clause**

Subordinate clauses introduced by a conjunction can also be placed before the main clause.

This does not change the word order in the subordinate clause. In the main clause however, the conjugated verb moves forward and is directly after the comma.

The subordinate clause thus assumes the position of the first idea in the whole sentence, and the conjugated verb in the main clause is the second idea of the whole sentence.

- Weil er ein Konto erÃ¶ffen **will**, **geht** zur Bank Nico.

Another ex. - Wo die Bank **ist, weiÃŸ** Nico schon

# Deutsch lernen - Niveau A1

These are my notes while learning German from [Nicoâ€™s Weg](https://learngerman.dw.com/en/nicos-weg) (primarily) and other resources from the Internet.

Special Thanks! to ChatGPT for helping me write a ton of text, which wouldnâ€™t be possible at all otherwise.

Why Nicoâ€™s Weg?

- Itâ€™s free! ðŸ¤·
- A web-series like format. Itâ€™s a story of a guy who came from Spain
    - It doesnâ€™t feel, at all, like youâ€™re in a boring language course
- Around 1 min of video per lesson and then questions to solve
- You learn to make sense of phrases when nativesâ€™ talk in their natural pace
- At the end of each chapter some good theory around Grammar
- One of the best way to go till B1 (as per peopleâ€™s own experiences)

## Sentence formation

- In German, word order in a sentence is flexible except the position of verbs.
- Declarative sentences
	- Subject + conjugated verb + [time] + Object [Manner + Place] + [other verb / verb prefix]
	- ex. Er (S) muss (CV) um 18 Uhr (T) seine Freunde (M) in den Park (P) treffen (V).
- Sometimes to put more emphasis on time, time can be put at position 1 **but the conjugated verb will always remain at the second position**
	- Time (position 1) + conjugated Verb  + Subject + [Manner] + [Place] + [other verb / verb prefix]
	- ex. Mittwochs (T) gehe (CV) ich (S) ins Fitnessstudio (P)
	- ex. Vielleicht gehe ich ins Fitnessstudios
- If we want to introduce 2 more objects (1 direct object and 1 indirect object) to the sentence, we stick with the usual subject in position 1, verb in position 2 rule.
	- Subject + conjugated verb + [time] + [indirect object == Manner] + place + direct object.
	- Ich (S) gebe (CV) dem Lehrer (IO / Manner) das Buch (DO)
- Question
	- Question word + Conjugated Verb +  Subject + [time] + [manner] + [place] + End Verb
- With conjuntion
	- Subject + Verb + Object, Conjunction + Sub +[time] + [manner] + [place]  + Conj. Verb
	- Ex. Ich (S) trinke (V) einen Kaffee (O), weil (conj) ich (S) Durst (info) habe (CV)
	- Ich (S) glaube (V), dass (conj) er (S) jetzt (T) bei der Arbeit (P) ist (CV).

## General Tips

- Donâ€™t assume that literal word-to-word translation from English will be correct and understood by the natives
- Try to learn and memorize day-to-day phrases as early as possible
- Start talking to yourself in German
    - Oh nein! es ist zwÃ¶lf Uhr (oh no! itâ€™s 12)
    - Ich muss morgen um 6 Uhr aufstehen (I need to get up at 6 tomorrow)
- Find someone who is a native and tell you how they say certain things colloquially
    - How do you ask - is there ice-cream available?
- Learning verb conjugation is an essential aspect of mastering German grammar, as it enables you to construct accurate and meaningful sentences. It's important to practice and familiarize yourself with these patterns to effectively communicate in German.
- Learning the correct articles is crucial for forming grammatically accurate sentences in German, as articles play a significant role in noun declension and sentence structure.

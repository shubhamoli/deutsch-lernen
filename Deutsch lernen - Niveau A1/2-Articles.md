# Articles

Articles are words that are used before nouns to provide information about the noun's number (singular or plural) and specificity (definite or indefinite).

**Definite articles** specify a particular noun and indicate that the speaker and listener both know which specific noun is being referred to.

While in English, the definite article is only "the" but in German we have many (see the table below) and they get influenced by the gender, number and case of the noun.

**Indefinite articles** indicate a non-specific or unidentified noun. They are used when the noun being referred to is not a particular one.

In English, the indefinite articles are "a" (used before consonant sounds) and "an" (used before vowel sounds). In German, indefinite articles also vary based on gender, number, and case of the noun.

💡Table to help you memorize both types of articles depending on gender, number and different cases.

## 💡Tips

- All possessives, and demonstratives, pointing something out, and a few quantatives also follow the same ending as shown in the above table
    - _meiner (mine)_, _seiner (his)_, _derselb-_ (the same) _derjenig-_ (the one) _dies-_ (this) _jen-_ (that) _jeglich-_ (any) _jed-_ (every) _manch-_ (some) _solch-_ (such) _welch-_ (which) _alle_ (all) _beide_ (both)
- We use the indefinite article (ein/eine) when we are talking about a type of object or entity.
    - Das ist **ein** Stift (This is a Pen) - we don’t know to whom it belongs.
- We use the definite article (der/die/das) when we have more precise knowledge about the object or entity.
    - Das ist **der** Stift von Oli (This is Oli’s Pen)
- In accusative, article for only Masculine changes (from the nominativ)
- In dativ, Masculine and Neutral are same
    - You can use the following to remember in the dative case
        - it’s “dem” because “him” (masculine)
        - it’s “der” because “her” (feminine)
- There are no separate indefinite articles like “a” or “an” depending upon the sound
- “ein” and “kein” can be (not always) inferred from the the definitive article
    - d**er** / ein**er** / kein**er**
    - d**em** / ein**em** / kein**em**
    - d**en** / ein**en** / kein**en**
- When not exact number or you are not sure who it belongs to, you only use the word in the plural – without any indefinite article. There is no indefinite plural article
    - Ex. Das sind Bleistifte (These are pencils)
- Genitive case is not widely used in the modern spoken German

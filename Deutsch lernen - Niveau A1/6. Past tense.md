# 6. Past tense

💡Don’t ignore this emoji. It means there is some very useful tip for you.

In German grammar, the past tense is primarily expressed using two different forms: the Simple Past (Präteritum) and the Present Perfect (Perfekt). Each form has its own usage and characteristics.

The verb forms in past tense and in present tense do not have the same endings.

Here's an overview of how both past tense forms work:

S**imple Past (Präteritum)**:

- The Simple Past is used to describe actions that took place in the past. It's commonly used in written language, especially in literature, newspaper, narratives, and formal contexts.
    
- It's formed by adding specific endings to the verb stem.
    
- Regular verbs generally follow a pattern, but irregular verbs have unique forms.
    
- Example with regular verb "gehen" (to go):
    
    - ich ging (I went)
    - du gingst (you went, informal singular)
    - er/sie/es ging (he/she/it went)
    - wir gingen (we went)
    - ihr gingt (you went, informal plural)
    - sie/Sie gingen (they/you went, formal)
- **Present Perfect (Perfekt)**:
    
    - The Present Perfect is used to describe actions that happened in the past and have relevance to the present. It's commonly used in spoken language and informal writing (private emails).
    - It's formed by using an auxiliary verb (either "haben" or "sein" depending on the main verb) and the past participle of the main verb.
    - Example with regular verb "gehen" (to go):
        - ich bin gegangen (I have gone)
        - du bist gegangen (you have gone, informal singular)
        - er/sie/es ist gegangen (he/she/it has gone)
        - wir sind gegangen (we have gone)
        - ihr seid gegangen (you have gone, informal plural)
        - sie/Sie sind gegangen (they/you have gone, formal)

## **Usage Differences**:

- Simple Past: More common in written narratives and formal texts. Can distance the action from the present.
- Present Perfect: More common in spoken language, everyday communication, and informal writing. Emphasizes the connection between past actions and the present.
- The choice between Simple Past and Present Perfect depends on the context and the style of language you're using. Practice with both forms will help you become comfortable with using the appropriate past tense form in various situations.

## 💡Tips

- Some verbs make the past participle without ge-:
    - Verbs which end in -ieren
    - Verbs with inseparable prefixes, i.e. be-, ent-, er-, ver-, zer-
    - Ex. fotografieren - fotografier-t / reservieren - reservier-t / besuchen -besucht
- In declarative sentences, the conjugated form of the auxiliary verb is in second position. The past participle comes at the end of the sentence.
    - Gestern habe ich eine Wanderung gemacht.
- In a "yes-no" question, the conjugated form of "haben" is in first position.
    - haben sie ein Packet?
- With regular verbs, the past participle usually begins with the prefix ge-; then comes the verb root, followed by a -t at the end.
    - Ex. ge-macht-t
    - Ex. ge-kocht-t
- If the verb root ends in -t or -d, an additional e is added. This extra e is also added after a cluster of consonants. Often, you will be able to identify when an e is necessary, as without it, the word would be hard to say.
    - arbeiten - ge-arbeit-et
    - öffnen - ge-öffn-et
- Need to learn and memorize the irregular verbs
    - The past participle of "nehmen" is irregular: "genommen"
    - The past participle of "finden" is "gefunden"
    - The past participle of “gehen” is “gegangen”
    - The past participle of "essen" has an additional "g" following the prefix "ge-"
- Random: Urlaub is vacation and Ausflug is outing

# 1. Nouns, Pronouns and Cases

üí° Don‚Äôt ignore this emoji, it means there is some very useful tip for you.

# Noun

Nouns ((in German: _Nomen_ or _Substantive_) are words that represent people, places, objects, concepts, or ideas. They are a fundamental part of speech and play a crucial role in constructing sentences.

In German, Nouns are classified based on gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and have specific forms in different cases (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive).

**Gender:** In German, all nouns have one of three genders: masculine, feminine, or neuter. The gender of a noun determines the forms of articles, adjectives, and pronouns that accompany it.

1. **Masculine Nouns:**
    - Der Tisch (the table)
    - Der Mann (the man)
    - Der Apfel (the apple)
2. **Feminine Nouns:**
    - Die Blume (the flower)
    - Die Frau (the woman)
    - Die Stadt (the city)
3. **Neuter Nouns:**
    - Das Buch (the book)
    - Das Kind (the child)
    - Das Haus (the house)

## üí°Tips

- All nouns are capitalized in German, not just the proper nouns like in English
- Always learn nouns with their Gender (with article at least)
- Even if a noun is non-human, we still need to use the correct gender (unlike English)
    - _Die Wohnung ist nicht gross, sie ist klein (The apartment is not big, she is small)_
- All plural nouns have the article ‚Äúdie‚Äù.
- Nouns ending in _-ung_ are mostly formed from a verb
    - Zahlen (to pay) - Zahlung (payment)
- Noun ending with _-ung_ are always feminine
    - Die Bestellung, Die Rechnung, etc
- _kein-_ is used to negate Nouns (and Pronouns), for rest you need to use the _nicht_
    - I habe kein Geld (I have no money)
    - I bin nicht reich (I am not rich)
- _Nicht_ and _nichts_ are different. _Nichts_ mean nothing
- All fruits are feminine except the Apple. It‚Äôs der Apfel (notice the Uppercase A, a noun)

# **Cases**

In German grammar, cases (F√§lle) are a grammatical feature that indicate the grammatical function of a noun, pronoun, or adjective within a sentence.

German has four cases: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive.

Each case serves a specific purpose and corresponds to different roles within a sentence. The cases are used to show the relationships between different elements of a sentence, such as the subject, direct object, indirect object, and possession.

Here's an overview of each case:

1. **Nominative Case** (der ****Nominativ)**:**The nominative case is used for the subject of the sentence.
    - [M] **Der Hund** bellt. (The dog is barking.)
    - [F] **Die Blume** bl√ºht. (The flower is blooming.)
    - [N] Das Auto f√§hrt schnell. (The car is driving fast.)
2. **Accusative Case** (der Akkusativ)**:** The accusative case is used for the direct object of a sentence.
    - [M] Ich sehe **den Tisch**. (I see the table.)
    - [F] Er liest **das Buch**. (He is reading the book.)
    - [N] Sie isst **einen Apfel**. (She is eating an apple.)
3. **Dative Case** (der Dative)**:** The dative case is used for the indirect object or the recipient of an action.
    - [M] Ich gebe **dem Mann** das Buch. (I give the book to the man.)
    - [F] Sie hilft **der Frau**. (She is helping the woman.)
    - [N] Das Kind gibt **dem Hund** einen Ball. (The child gives the dog a ball.)
4. **Genitive Case** (der Genitiv)**:** The genitive case indicates possession or relationships between nouns.
    - Das Auto **des Mannes** ist neu. (The man's car is new.)
    - Der Name **der Stadt** ist Berlin. (The name of the city is Berlin.)
    - Das Haus **des Kindes** ist gro√ü. (The child's house is big.)

Here is an another example which shows how the article of nouns changes with different _cases._

- I gave bone my dog
    - I is the subject (nominative)
    - Gave is the verb
    - Bone is the direct object to the verb (accusative)
    - Dog is the indirect object to the verb (dativ)
- Der Polizist trinkt einen Apfelsaft im Supermarkt, here:
    - _Der Polizist_ ist Nominativ
    - _Einen Apfelsaft_ ist Akkusativ
    - _Im (in + dem) Supermarkt_ ist Dativ

**It's important to note that while the genitive case is used less frequently in modern spoken** German, the other cases (nominative, accusative, and dative) remain crucial for sentence construction and conveying meaning accurately. The choice of case depends on the role of the noun or pronoun within the sentence.

Learning and mastering the cases in German is fundamental for understanding sentence structure, expressing relationships between different sentence elements, and constructing grammatically correct and coherent sentences.

# Pronouns

Pronouns (In German: _Pronomen_) like in other languages, are words that are used to replace nouns or noun phrases to avoid repetition and to refer to people, objects, or ideas. Pronouns help make sentences more concise and fluent.

Here's an overview of different types of pronouns in German:

**Personal Pronouns:**

Personal pronouns are used to refer to specific persons or things. Unlike English, they change based on the grammatical case (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive), gender, and number (singular or plural).

Here is a Table which shows personal pronouns depending upon the _case_.

|Nominative|Accusative|Dative|Genitive (possessive pronouns)|
|---|---|---|---|
|ich (I)|mich (me)|mir (to me)|meiner (of mine)|
|du (you, informal singular)|dich (you, informal singular)|dir (to you, informal)|deiner (of yours, informal singular)|
|er (he)|Ihn (him)|ihm (to him)|seiner (of his)|
|sie (she)|sie (her)|ihr (to her)|ihrer (of her)|
|es (it)|es (it)|ihm (to it)|seiner (of its)|
|wir (we)|uns (us)|uns (to us)|unser (of ours)|
|ihr (you all, informal plural)|euch (you all, informal plural)|euch (to you all, informal plural)|euer (of yours all, informal plural)|
|Sie (they, formal)|Sie (them, formal)|Ihnen (to them, formal)|Ihrer (of theirs, formal plural)|
|Sie (you, formal)|Sie (you, format(|Ihnen (to you, formal)|Ihrer (of theirs, formal singular)|

Examples (dative case):

- [M] Schmeckt die Paella Nico? ‚Äì Ja, die Paella schmeckt ihm.
- [F] Schmeckt die Paella Nina? ‚Äì Ja, die Paella schmeckt ihr.
- [N] Schmeckt die Paella dem Kind? ‚Äì Ja, die Paella schmeckt ihm.

**Demonstrative Pronouns:** Demonstrative pronouns indicate specific objects or ideas. Unlike English, they also change based on gender, case, and number.

- Dieser (this) / diese (this) / dieses (this)
- Jener (that) / jene (that) / jenes (that)

üí°Pay attention, the ending of the words _dies- and jen-_ is similar to the [definitive article](https://www.notion.so/2-Articles-d4970771c321483e8cc308db99f7c597?pvs=21) of the noun depending upon its case. This needs to be strictly followed in order to construct the meaningful sentences.

**Interrogative Pronouns:** Interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions and are also used as relative pronouns in some cases.

- Wer (who)
- Was (what)
- Welcher (which) / welche (which) / welches (which)

üí°Pay attention, the ending of the word _welch-_ is similar to the [definitive article](https://www.notion.so/2-Articles-d4970771c321483e8cc308db99f7c597?pvs=21) of the noun depending upon its case. This needs to be strictly followed in order to construct the meaningful sentences.

Here is an example:

- Welcher (der) Pullover ist am teuersten? ‚Äì Dieser Pullover ist am teuersten.
- Welchen (den) Pullover findest du am sch√∂nsten? ‚Äì Diesen Pullover finde ich am sch√∂nsten.
- Welche (die) Hose ist am billigsten? ‚Äì Diese Hose ist am billigsten.
- Welches (das) Kleid m√∂chten Sie? ‚Äì Ich m√∂chte dieses Kleid, bitte.
- Welche (die) Turnschuhe nehmen Sie? ‚Äì Ich nehme diese Turnschuhe hier.

## üí°Tips

- ‚Äúsie‚Äù and ‚ÄúSie‚Äù are different. sie is she (or they), whereas Sie is a formal way to address anyone
    - Sie (formal) is always capitalized regardless of its position in the sentence
    - If ‚Äúsie‚Äù is at the beginning of the sentence then ofcourse it will be capitalized to ‚ÄúSie‚Äù, you will then need to understand the context to understand it properly
- es used as a personal pronoun. The pronoun _es_ is usually used to replace a neuter¬†noun:
    - Wo ist das Buch? ‚Äì Es ist in der Tasche. (es = das Buch)
- Now you know, what‚Äôs the difference between
    - Wie geht‚Äôs dir? (informal)
    - Wie geht‚Äôs Ihnen? (formal)
- Similar to ‚ÄúSie‚Äù (formal), ‚ÄúIhnen‚Äù is always capitalized
- Even if it‚Äôs non-human, pronouns are still gendered.
    - Die Wohnung (apartment a non-human) ist nicht gross, sie ist klein (she is small)
- Following certain verbs, like "anrufen (to call)", "sehen (to call)", "kennen (to know)", "brauchen (need)" and "lieben (to love)", the personal pronoun must be in the accusative.
- when a personal pronoun comes after a preposition or a verb that takes the accusative, it¬†will also be in the accusative.
- Pronouns or nouns that follow _f√ºr_ are always in the accusative.
- Possessive determiners in the accusative
    - To express ownership or belonging, the possessive determiner is used instead of the indefinite article
    - In the singular, the endings are the same as the indefinite article.
    - In the accusative plural, the possessive determiner ends in -e
